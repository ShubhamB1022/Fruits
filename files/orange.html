   <b> <p>Essentially, an orange is a ball of juice sacs protected by a waxy skin, the peel. The peel consists of a thin outer layer called the flavedo and a thicker, fibrous inner layer called the albedo . Orange-coloured substances called carotenoids in the flavedo give the fruit its characteristic colour.

    Oranges are a type of healthy, low calorie, highly nutritious citrus fruit. As part of a healthful and varied diet, oranges contribute to strong, clear skin and can help lower a personâ€™s risk of many conditions. <br><br>
    
    This popular citrus fruit is particularly known for its vitamin C content. However, oranges contain a range of other plant compounds and antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and work against disease.<br> <br>
