   <b> <p>Various studies suggest that blueberries can benefit the body in many ways. Possible health benefits of blueberries include improving heart health, increasing bone strength, and lowering blood pressure.
    
    <br> <br>

    Blueberries contain a plant compound called anthocyanin. This gives blueberries both their blue color and many of their health benefits. <br><br>
One cup of blueberries provides 24 percent of a person recommended daily allowance of vitamin C.
Use blueberries to top waffles, pancakes, yogurt, oatmeal, or cereal, blend them in a smoothie or syrup, or fold them into muffins and sweet breads.
 <br><br>
    
 People who use blood-thinners, such as warfarin, should speak to their doctor before increasing their intake of blueberries, as the high vitamin K content can affect blood clotting.<br> <br>
