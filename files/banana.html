   <b> <p>Bananas contain about 74% water, 23% carbohydrate, 1% protein, and 0.5% fat. A 4-ounce banana without the peel is a good source of vitamin B6, potassium, and fiber. Other parts of the banana plant are consumed besides the fruit. The heart of the growing pseudostem is eaten in India.
    Best of all, it’s tasty and easy to add to your diet as part of smoothies and many other dishes. <br> <br>

    Bananas are a rich source of carbs, which occur mainly as starch in unripe bananas and sugars in ripe bananas.

    The carb composition of bananas changes drastically during ripening.
    
    The main component of unripe bananas is starch. Green bananas contain up to 80% starch measured in dry weight.
    
    <br> <br>

    During ripening, the starch is converted into sugars and ends up being less than 1% when the banana is fully ripe (2).
    
    The most common types of sugar in ripe bananas are sucrose, fructose, and glucose. In ripe bananas, the total sugar content can reach more than 16% of the fresh weight (2).
    
    Bananas have a relatively low glycemic index (GI) of 42–58, depending on their ripeness. The GI is a measure of how quickly carbs in food enter your bloodstream and raise blood sugar (3). <br> <br>
